I have zero coding experience. I want to build a referral platform for
Myanmar.

Create a modern, attractive Vite + React + TypeScript project with these
rules:

\- Dark mode default

\- Main colors: dark background (#0F172A to #020617 gradient), teal
primary (#14B8A6), gold accent (#F59E0B)

\- Use Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components (button, card, badge, avatar)

\- Rounded corners, subtle gradients, hover effects, glassmorphism cards

\- Mobile-first, fast loading, works on low-end Android phones

\- Support Burmese font (use Padauk or Pyidaungsu from Google Fonts as
fallback)

\- English + Burmese text (side by side or simple toggle for now)

Generate the basic folder structure, tailwind.config.js, global CSS, and
a clean App.tsx with:

\- Hero section (big title \"ReferTRM\", subtitle about earning via KPay
and low cost for companies)

\- Trust bar (25 real open roles, 1000+ CVs, 150+ referrers)

\- Two big buttons: \"Browse Jobs\" and \"For Companies\"

Explain every file and change simply. Do not apply anything dangerous.

Improve the hero section of my referral platform.

Make it very attractive and trustworthy for Myanmar clients and
referrers.

Requirements:

\- Dark gradient background

\- Big title \"ReferTRM -- Powered by \[Your Agency Name\]\"

\- Subtitle: \"Refer friends → Earn up to 500,000 MMK via KPay (85% to
you). Companies pay only 50,000 MMK flat success fee per hire.\"

\- Show 3 trust numbers: 25 Real Open Roles, 1,000+ CVs Ready, 150+
Active Referrers

\- Two large buttons: \"Browse 25 Real Jobs\" and \"For Companies -- 3
Free Hires\"

\- Add Burmese translation below each English sentence (use polite
Burmese)

\- Use teal (#14B8A6) and gold (#F59E0B) accents

\- Make buttons have gradient and hover glow

Show the updated code and explain simply.

Add a beautiful \"Jobs\" section to my referral platform.

Show 25 real job openings in attractive cards.

Rules:

\- Dark cards with teal border on hover

\- Each card shows:

  - Job title (big)

  - Company name

  - Location (Yangon / Remote / Mandalay etc.)

  - Salary range (if available)

  - Big gold text: \"Refer & Earn up to XXX,000 MMK\"

  - Small text: \"Company pays only 50,000 MMK success fee\"

  - Skills tags (small badges)

  - Large \"Refer via Telegram\" button (gradient teal-cyan)

\- Make it grid: 1 column mobile, 2--3 columns desktop

\- Use Burmese translation for labels (e.g. \"လစာ အတိုင်းအတာ\",
\"ရည်ညွှန်းပါ\")

\- For now hard-code 6 example jobs --- I will add the real 25 later

Generate the component and show how to add it to the page.

Create a professional \"For Companies\" section for my Myanmar referral
platform.

Main message: \"Hire faster and cheaper with ReferTRM\"

Requirements:

\- Headline: \"Hire Smarter & Cheaper\"

\- Text: \"Get 3 free successful hires to try the platform. After that,
pay only 50,000 MMK flat success fee per hire -- any position.\"

\- Show pricing cards/plans: Free Trial (3 free hires), Bronze, Silver,
Gold, Diamond

\- Each card shows name, price (MMK/month), slots, key features, CTA
button

\- Make Silver card highlighted as \"Most Popular\" (ring or badge)

\- Use teal/gold colors, dark cards, hover effects

\- Add Burmese translation for key texts

\- End with big contact button: \"Contact Us on Telegram for Beta
Pricing\"

Generate the full component code and explain how to add it.

Add a \"Why Refer With Us\" section to motivate referrers in Myanmar.

Requirements:

\- Dark background, attractive layout

\- Headline: \"Why Refer Friends With ReferTRM?\"

\- 3--4 points in cards or list:

  - Keep 85% of the reward (up to 425,000--500,000 MMK)

  - Paid directly to your KPay wallet

  - Bonus multiplier when you complete quick skill lessons

  - Trusted platform powered by real recruitment agency

\- Use gold color for reward amounts

\- Add Burmese translation

\- End with button: \"Join as Referrer\"

Generate the component code.

Make my referral platform feel like a real mobile app.

Add PWA support so people can install it on their phone home screen.

Also:

\- Add Burmese font fallback (Padauk or Pyidaungsu)

\- Make sure everything is mobile-friendly (responsive)

\- Add simple loading skeletons for job cards

\- Add subtle animations on hover/click (using Tailwind or Framer
Motion)

\- Add a footer with agency name and contact
